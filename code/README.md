# infinite_walk
Hand-crafted unlimited scale random walk generator

## Purpose
Have you ever wanted to generate a huge random walk image but didn't want to be limited by preconceived dimensions? Use this script to generate a random walk image by setting the number of steps. It is this number that determines the final size of hte image, but not until the full walk cycle has been completed. This leads to a huge variety of possible images.

## Future plans
* User sets rules (turn probabilities) for the walker
* Run up to 1,000 walk cycles simultaneously

## Blender Plug-in
We hope to develop a pipeline to transform our random walks into environments using Blender.
The following illustrates how we go from an array generated by our script to a rendered environment in Blender.
